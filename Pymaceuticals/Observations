Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook.

1.Capomulin and Ramicane have the lowest tumor volumes at the end of the study. 
2.When looking at just the distribution of sex of the unique mouse IDs, the spread is fairly even. (However, when looking at gender distribution across trials, it's less even)
3.Capomulin and Ramicane also have the most data points across the study. I wonder if these drug trials received more funding, etc, that may have skewed the data in their favor? Was this study double blind?
